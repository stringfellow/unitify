Unitify
=======

Take units in one locale and change them to another, in place (Chrome).


Motivation
----------

When I'm reading an article or recipe, I'm too lazy to take on the extra
cognitive burden of remembering how to convert things or switching context to
look them up.

So, this plugin just replaces stuff in the page, with a title-text showing the
original text.


Test page
---------

http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://raw.github.com/stringfellow/unitify/master/test.html


Help me make it better?
-----------------------

Fork it, test it using the test.html:

    unitify $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then submit a pull request.
